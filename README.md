# UK Cross-Government Metadata Exchange Model

A metadata model for describing data assets for exchanging between UK government organisations.

This repository uses:
- [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/): YAML  specification of the metadata model which can be translated into JSON-Schema and SHACL, as well as having documentation generated
- [MkDocs Tech Docs Template](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/): GOV.UK styling for the [MkDocs Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for service [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) technical documentation

## Website

The website is automatically deployed when a new commit is made to the `main` branch using the `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yaml` action. The website is available from:

[https://co-cddo.github.io/ukgov-metadata-exchange-model/](https://co-cddo.github.io/ukgov-metadata-exchange-model/)

## Documentation site

The documentation site is hosted as a github pages site. See repo configuration for details.

The layout of pages have been overridden from the base jinja templates provided by LinkML. This is to allow renaming of pages elements, e.g. slots are displayed as properties, and for customising where elements appear on the page. The custom jinja templates can be found in [`src/docs/templates`](/src/docs/templates/).

The `Usage Notes` section of a property page is generated from the `comments:` property. The rendering relies on structure of the comments property as shown below.

```yaml
comments: |
      purpose:
