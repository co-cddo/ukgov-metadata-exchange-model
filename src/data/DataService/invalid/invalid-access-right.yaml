title: Address Lookup
summary: DWP single strategic solution for looking up addresses including fuzzy search and UPRN.
description: The location-service provides endpoints to perform a range of address based queries for UK locations. The reference data used is provided by Ordnance Survey and covers Great Britain Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands.\nThe API currently supports the following functions:\nPostcode Lookup and filtering\nFuzzy address searching\nUnique Property Reference Number (UPRN) lookup\nAddress matching\nData provided\n\nPostcode lookup and fuzzy address search\n\nThis endpoint serves as both the standard postcode lookup and the fuzzy lookup. If you call the endpoint with just a search string query parameter the service will perform a fuzzy search against your string and bring back the closest matching results.\n\nFor example sending a request to the lookup endpoint with the search string “holy island castle” will return the following address as the top result :\n \NATIONAL TRUST\\n\LINDISFARNE CASTLE\\n\HOLY ISLAND\\n\BERWICK-UPON-TWEED\\n\TD15 2SH\\n\nAlternatively if you want to limit your search to a specific postcode you can call the endpoint with the postcode query parameter set. If you call the endpoint with just the postcode then the service will return all addresses for that postcode.\n\nIf you call the endpoint with both postcode and search string the service will return only addresses that match the provided postcode and search string.\n\nThere is also one further parameter for this endpoint (excludeBusiness) which if set will restrict the returned result list to non-commercial addresses.\n\nUnique Property Reference Number lookup\n\nThis endpoint will take a unique property reference number (UPRN) as a query parameter and return the specific address record for that ID if present in the data set. As the data set contains a snapshot of current addresses it may be the case that UPRNs which are no longer valid get removed from the data set by Ordnance Survey.\n\nAddress matching\n\nThis endpoint provides an address matching function. It will take an unstructured address string along with a postcode and try to find an exact match in the data set. If the service can find an exact match then that specific record will be returned. If no match is found then no records are returned. This endpoint also uses fuzzy matching algorithms which allow it to cope with spelling mistakes transposed characters and other errors within the search string.
