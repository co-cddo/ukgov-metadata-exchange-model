          purpose:
            Use of `contactName` provides an avenue for users to provide feedback or request additional information about a resource to assist in determining its relevance and potential use or in understanding and interpreting the content.
          distinctFrom:
            - contributor: a person or organisation responsible for making significant contributions to the content of the described resource.
            - [creator](/data-catalogue-schemas/creator): the business entity (department, agency, board, commission, etc.) primarily responsible for the creation of the content of the resource.
            - issuing body: the department, agency, board or commission responsible for making the described resource publicly available.
          guidance:
            Contact information should be included for all new information resources that are added to the Government Data Catalogue. Generally, `contactName` will be a support or branch unit that will either respond to the user or refer the inquiry to a subject matter expert.
            
            Because the Government Data Catalogue may include historical resources for which there is no longer a suitable contact point, this element has not been made mandatory.
            
            When a `contactName` is provided for an information resource, it should be combined with a [`email`](/data-catalogue-schemas/email).

      purpose: 
        Using alternative title can assist retrieval and help to distinguish one resource from another, as users may be more familiar with an informal version of a title.
      distinctFrom:
        - [title](/data-catalogue-schemas/title): the name given to the resource and by which the resource is formally known;
        - Digital filenames or website titles.
      guidance:
        Use alternative title for commonly-used titles of a resource other than the title. This could include title abbreviations, title aliases, assigned titles, or names by which a resource is commonly or informally known.

        Alternative titles should be derived from the content of the resource, with special attention paid to the title page, and reflect how users would search for a resource.

        Examples: 
        1. Worth Report  
            - Title: A future of choices, a choice of futures: report of the Commission on Education planning  
            - Alternative Title: Worth Report (named after the head of the commission which wrote the report)
        2. Assured Income  
            - Title: Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped Regulations  
            - Alternative Title: AISH Regulations
        3. Family Size  
            - Title (for a dataset): Family Size, UK, England and Wales, 2011  
            - Alternative Title: Family Size

        Include special characters such as quotations marks, apostrophes, and accented characters, e.g. MÃ©tis.

      The date, or date and time, on which the content of an information resource is created or compiled. 
      
      __When used on a metadata record__ The date and time on which an information resource is made available through the catalogue.
    range: date
    comments: |
      purpose:
      The use of `created` helps users assess the relevance of the content to their information needs, and allows users to distinguish between when the content of an information resource was created or compiled and when the resource was publicly released.
      __When used for a catalogue record__
      Use of `created` allows users to distinguish between the date a resource was published and the date it was included in the Government Data Catalogue. It also allows users to locate resources recently added to the Government Data Catalogue.
      distinctFrom:
      - [`created`](/data-catalogue-schemas/created/) applied to a catalogue record: the date the resource was first added to the Government Data Catalogue.
      - [`issued`](/data-catalogue-schemas/issued/): the date the resource was originally published or otherwise made publicly available for the first time, which may have been prior to its inclusion in the catalogue.
      __When used for a catalogue record__
      `created` applied to a data asset: the date the intellectual content of the resource was completed or compiled in the form in which it was approved for and eventually released.
      [issued](/data-catalogue-schemas/issued): the date a resource was originally published or otherwise made publicly available for the first time. Date Issued and Date Added to Catalogue might be, but do not have to be, the same date.
      [modified](/data-catalogue-schemas/modified): the date on which the content of a resource was changed, or when a new issue of a serial resource was added to the metadata record.
      guidance:
      Systems tend to identify the âdate createdâ of a resource as the date on which it is captured into a repository. The actual creation of a resource and its capture frequently do take place on the same date, but this is not always the case, for example:
      - Disseminating a resource sometime after its date created;
      - Capturing metadata about a resource into a repository that does not contain the resources itself.
      `created` should reflect the date the intellectual content of the resource was completed or compiled in the form in which it was eventually released.
      Be as specific as possible, including month and day as well as year, if known. 
      Some scenarios might be:
      - A dataset compiled in April 2015 published on July 2015 (`created` is `2015-04`);
      - A report completed in September 2015 but publicly released in January 2016 (`created` is `2015-09`);
      __When used for a catalogue record__
      `created` will be the date the metadata record was first âpublishedâ within the Government Data Catalogue environment.

    comments: |
      purpose: 
      Provides context and identifies the defined authority responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of an information resource, thus supporting quality assurance of content and accountability for information resources.
      distinctFrom:
      - [contact](/data-catalogue-schemas/contactName): provides a contact point to obtain further information or provide feedback about a resource or its metadata.
      - contributor: makes a contribution to the content of a resource, but does not have primary responsibility.
      - issuing body: the business entity (department, agency, board, commission, etc.) responsible for making the resource publicly available.
      guidance:
      A `creator` is almost always an organisation, not an individual. The `contributor` element can be used to identify specific individuals involved in the creation of the described resource. However, there may be rare occasions where the `creator` is an individual.

      `creator` may be a department, agency, board, commission, or other entity of the UK Government, or a non-government entity under contract to the Government. The organisation name should be the official name, not an abbreviation or acronym. Do not include the names of organisation units such as divisions and/or branches.

      `creator` is repeatable if more than one government department, agency, board, commission or other entity shared primary responsibility for the creation of the resource.

      In the Government Data Catalogue context, `creator` and issuing body may be the same organisation but this may not always be the case.
    todos:
      - Update guidance to use organisation slugs
      - Decide what to do about issuing body
      - Decide what to do about `contributor`

    comments: |
      purpose:
      Use of `issued` allows users to determine the currency of the described resource. It also helps the user to distinguish between the date the described resource was created, the date it was first made publicly available, and the date it was added to the Government Data Catalogue.
      distinctFrom:
      - DATE ADDED TO CATALOGUE: the date on which the resource was included in the Government Data Catalogue.
      - METADATA RECORD CREATION DATE: the date on which a new Government Data Catalogue metadata record is created.
      - [`modified`](/data-catalogue-schemas/modified/): the date on which the content of an information resource was changed, or when a new issue of a serial resource was added to the metadata record
      guidance:
      The issued date should indicate the date on which the described resource was first published or otherwise released to the public.
      Be as specific as possible, including month and day as well as year, if known.
      If the resource was never publicly released before inclusion in the Government Data Catalogue, the DATE ISSUED and DATE ADDED TO CATALOGUE would be the same.
      Some scenarios might be:
      - A dataset compiled in April 2015 published on July 2015 (`issued` is `2015-07`);
      - A report completed in September 2015 but publicly released in January 2016 (`issued` is `2016-01`);

    comments: |
      purpose:
        The use of `modified`:
        - Helps users assess the relevance of the content to their information needs.
        - Helps users distinguish when the content of an information resource was changed after it was initially issued.
        - Provides evidence of accountability and quality control by tracking revisions to the content of an information resource.
      distinctFrom:
        - METADATA RECORD UPDATE DATE: the date, or date and time, on which a catalogue record is changed.
      guidance:
        The DATE MODIFIED refers to the last date on which the content of an information resource revised. The date of the most recent update is the only date retained.
        Be as specific as possible, including month and day as well as year, if known.
        In the case of records which describe an information resource with more than one item (file), such as serial resources or resources with more than one part (eg. book chapters), the DATE MODIFIED should reflect the most recent date that any one item was modified. For example, if a new issue of a serial is added to a record, the DATE MODIFIED should be the date that the new issue was modified.
        For most publications and many other information resources in the Government Data Catalogue, the DATE CREATED and DATE MODIFIED will be the same and will likely remain the same.
