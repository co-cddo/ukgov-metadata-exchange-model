    - "purpose:\n  A meaningful title describes the content of a resource concisely,\
      \ and supports access, speed of identification, and control of content.\ndistinctFrom:\n\
      \  - [`alternativeTitle`](/data-catalogue-schemas/alternativeTitle): any form\
      \ of a title used as a substitute or additional access point to the title of\
      \ the resource.\n  - [`identifier`](/data-catalogue-schemas/identifier): a unique\
      \ number or code that unambiguously identifies the described resource.\n  -\
      \ SERIES TITLE: A distinctive collective title applied to an information resource\
      \ and one or more other resources that also have their own separate titles.\n\
      \  - Digital file name assigned by a user to an electronic file such as a web\
      \ page or desktop document, e.g. \"www.saintranet.gov.ab.ca/7.htm\" or \"specifications.doc\"\
      .\nguidance:\n  Useful titles distinguish one resource from another, so organisations\
      \ should establish consistent naming practices for all forms of information\
      \ resources.\n  For resources with existing titles, the title should be taken\
      \ as it appears in the content of the described resource. If multiple forms\
      \ of titles appear in the resource, choose the title as it appears on the title\
      \ page of the resource, if applicable.\n  If no title appears within the described\
      \ resource or within metadata provided by the creator of the resource, a title\
      \ will have to be created. Use the following guidelines in creating titles when\
      \ necessary:\n  - Create a brief and meaningful title to convey its topic or\
      \ purpose;\n  - Place important words near the beginning of the title;\n  -\
      \  Ensure that the title is in the same language as the resource;\n  - Minimizing\
      \ the use of abbreviations and acronyms;\n  - Add values to a title such as\
      \ a version number, status or version date if a resource is one of many with\
      \ the same or similar titles. For example, \"Submission guide 2003\", \"Submission\
      \ guide 2007\".\n  Titles should be entered in sentence case. Only the first\
      \ word and proper nouns should be capitalized.\n  Separate titles and subtitles\
      \ by a colon preceded and followed by a space.\n"

    - "purpose:\n  Subject\n  Assigning subjects enables users to find resources on\
      \ the same topic consistently and efficiently. Using a controlled vocabulary\
      \ external to the catalogue allows users to find related resources across jurisdictions\
      \ and catalogues. These vocabularies also generally allow for more precise description\
      \ of the subject matter of a resource than is possible with the TOPIC element.\n\
      \  Topic\n  Enables users to find resources on the same topic consistently and\
      \ efficiently, and provides access to related resources across the Government\
      \ Data Catalogue and the Data Marketplace.\ndistinctFrom:\n  Subject\n  - TOPIC:\
      \ provides a higher-level subject description of the content of a resource using\
      \ a controlled vocabulary developed or adopted for the catalogue .\n  - [`description`](/data-catalogue-schemas/description):\
      \ a concise narrative of the content of the resource.\n  - [`keyword`](/data-catalogue-schemas/keyword):\
      \ uncontrolled words or phrases assigned to the resource to assist discovery\
      \ and retrieval.\n  - TYPE: the business structure of the content of a resource,\
      \ e.g. fact sheet, policy, report, guide, statistics.\n  Topic\n  - [`description`](/data-catalogue-schemas/description):\
      \ a concise narrative of the content of the resource.\n  - [`keyword`](/data-catalogue-schemas/keyword):\
      \ uncontrolled words or phrases assigned to the resource to assist discovery\
      \ and retrieval.\n  - SPATIAL COVERAGE: the geographical area or spatial extent\
      \ covered by the content of a resource.\n  - SUBJECT: a term taken from an external\
      \ controlled vocabulary which generally describes a resource at a more specific\
      \ level.\n  - TEMPORAL COVERAGE: the time frame covered by the content of the\
      \ resource.\n  - TYPE: the business structure of the content of a resource,\
      \ e.g. fact sheet, policy, report, guide, statistics.\nguidance:\n  Subject\n\
      \  A SUBJECT describes what a resource is \"about\". For example:\n  - \"Maps\"\
      \ is a subject value if a resource is about map-making, but not if it \"is\"\
      \ a map;\n  - \"Claims\" is a subject value if a resource is about making claims,\
      \ but not if it \"is' a claim.\n  SUBJECT is a container element with two sub-elements.\
      \ Metadata values are contained in the sub-elements.\n  Each SUBJECT element\
      \ has two mandatory sub-elements:\n  - Subject vocabulary: The controlled vocabulary\
      \ being used to describe the information resource. This will be chosen from\
      \ a menu. If the controlled vocabulary you wish is not available, contact the\
      \ Government Data Catalogue administrator team to discuss the possibility of\
      \ adding the vocabulary.\n  - Subject term: The unique subject term chose from\
      \ the controlled vocabulary identified in the subject vocabulary field.\n  Many\
      \ resources will be \"about\" more than one topic, so more than one subject\
      \ will often be assigned to provide multiple access points to a particular resource.\
      \ Do not assign Subjects to which the resource is only peripherally related.\n\
      \  Topic\n  TOPICS are chosen from a controlled vocabulary developed or adopted\
      \ for the Government Data Catalogue. The intent of the vocabulary is to provide\
      \ a limited list of broad terms that cover all the different subject matter\
      \ of the information resources contained in the Government Data Catalogue.\n\
      \  A TOPIC describes what a resource is \"about\". Assign at least one TOPIC\
      \ to a resource, reflecting the most significant facet of its content. Many\
      \ resources will be \"about\" more than one topic, so assign as many TOPICS\
      \ as applicable to provide substantial value for finding resources about a topic.\
      \ Do not assign TOPICS to which the resource is only peripherally related.\n"
