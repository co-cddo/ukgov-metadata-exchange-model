  "description": "## Overview\n\nThe API in its current state supports the following functions:\n\n- Revoke an existing Reporting Company from submitting Interest Restriction Returns\n- Appoint a new Reporting Company for submitting Interest Restriction Returns\n- Submit an Interest Restriction Return (full)\n- Submit an Interest Restriction Return (abbreviated)\n\nThis API uses User Restricted Endpoints. Please find further details on the [Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.\n\nFor more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, see [Tutorials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).\n\n## Errors\n\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n- 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n- 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n- 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can use the [HMRC Developer Sandbox](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing) to test the API. The Sandbox is an enhanced testing service that functions as a simulator of HMRCâ€™s production environment.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWhen an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on versioning.",
